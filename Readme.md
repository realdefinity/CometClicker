## Why i made it

A lot of the most popular auto clickers like OP Auto Clicker and Speed Auto Clicker are pretty inaccurate at higher speeds. Setting CPS to 50 might give you 40.. or 60. Technically this is not an issue since they are still clicking _fast_, but I am a perfectionist and I wanted something that could actually click at the CPS I set it to, even at higher speeds. So I made this.

Additionally, many auto clickers have 1 good feature but are missing the other features I want. My auto clicker combines all the featurs I have seen in other auto clickers, and even adds some of my own ideas.

Performance is also a heavy focus of this. While version 3 and onwards run on a web based UI, The total RAM usage is around 50mb and I intend for it to never go above 100mb.

## Other Info
1. Windows has a limit of around 500 CPS for mouse events. This is because Windows timer resolution is limited to about 1ms at minimum (1000cps) but windows also needs to do other things, so the practical limit is around 800cps, but since I can not guarantee that performance on every computer, I set the limit to 500cps.
